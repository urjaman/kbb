Using the built C201 kernels:
put this in pacman.conf:

[kbbpkgs]
SigLevel = Optional
Server = https://urja.dev/kbbpkgs/armv7h/

Do a pacman -Syu
(a -Sy technically would get the repo, but you need to be up-to-date...)

then pacman -S linux-c201 linux-c201-chromebook
for the 6.1 one.

Note: the -chromebook packages are untested at this point, because
i'm running my own old build of u-boot.

Expect no support (sorry), i'm running this only for myself.

(This thing updates a couple of other kernels of mine.
Don't ask about them.)
